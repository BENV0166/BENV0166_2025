    "An architect has asked you determine what the optimize the design parameters for the window assemblies on a building they are designing. The proposed building is highly glazed, naturally ventilated and in a temperate climate. The design parameters which can be varied are the window-to-wall ratio, depth of the fixed shading, and the u and g-values of the window assembly. The values that they have asked you to optimize are:\n",

Compare the results of the weighted sum method to the pareto front approach, and the results of each combination of objective. Comment on which you think is the best approach and why and any adjustments you would make to the procedure."
